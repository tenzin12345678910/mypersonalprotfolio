<h1>2018</h1>
After releasing their third full length album “LOVE YOURSELF: Tear” in May, one of the biggest events that happened to BTS is
 most probably their world premiere of ‘FAKE LOVE’ performance on Billboard Music Awards 2018 (BBMAs). In addition to that,

 They had also appeared on the front cover of ‘TIME’ magazine as the ‘Next Generation Leaders’.With that being said, in the
 final series of their “LOVE YOURSELF” trilogy, BTS has once again proved their popularity when they released their repackaged
 album “LOVE YOURSELF: Answer” in August 2018. They had more than 1.5 million pre-orders and also sold 868,052 copies in the first
 week. The album debuted as number 1 on Billboard 200 and it is the very first time for K-pop idols to have two chart-topping albums
  in the same year!
Recently, “LOVE YOURSELF: Answer” has also earned a Grammy nomination for the best recording package. Although they were not
 nominated for other categories, many experts believe that it is already a huge step for BTS.
 Furthermore, the 7 boys have also embarked on their “LOVE YOURSELF World Tour”, visiting their fans from different parts of
 the world. It is their first time to have a stadium concert in the U.S. and also their first time to have their dome tour in
  Japan! Of course, all of these shows were all sold out.
