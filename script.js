The “love” that BTS aims to convey in the LOVE YOURSELF series is both the individual experience of a boy growing into adulthood and a message of peace and unity to our society today. In the mini album 承 'HER' that begins this new narrative, the image of boys in love for the first time are expressed in a refreshing and cheerful take that aims to talk about the topic of “love” while immersed in a coming-of-age tale."

  summary: "Seven young men on the threshold of their 20s. Now entering their young adulthood, the members of BTS sang in their previous album, The most beautiful moment in life pt.1, about people their age being threatened by uncertainty. Released seven months after that first installment, The most beautiful moment in life pt.2 sings about the energy of youth barreling forward, embracing even the uncertainty and insecurity. Now beginning to taste the bitterness of grown-up life, they can easily sense that life isn't always beautiful. However, they continue to sprint forward, relying only on their two destitute legs and the fire in their hearts. There’s nothing else to do but keep running. Facing the powerlessness of one’s youth, they collide and shatter and still cry out that “it’s okay to fall, it’s okay to get hurt.” That is the beauty of this moment. Continuing the tradition of the previous album, the members including RM, SUGA, j-hope, V and Jung Kook add their names to the producing and songwriting credits, showing their own growth as musicians. The lyrics are more profound and the music more passionate. The “Youth Series” concludes with The most beautiful moment in life pt.2, but the boys are only now on the starting line. “Never Mind”, BTS is just getting started."

  summary: "The boys are no longer in their school uniforms. They have become tougher, singing that their love is not to be treated lightly. A year and two months into their debut, BTS made sure that the visuals, performance and all the elements of their first studio album are flawless. Tracks that highlight the different genres of hip hop—South, West, Boom Bap and Trap—provide a clear direction of BTS' music. The title track “Danger” is a tightly-composed hybrid hip hop song with a piercing punk-rock guitar sound that features stark rap, a powerful hook and exhilarating shouting."

The new album, released on February 12, continues to focus on school and teens. As hinted by the title, SKOOL LUV AFFAIR, the album’s main theme is the love that blossoms in the school. This album is a culmination of the “School Trilogy” project that discusses the topics of most interest to teens their own age—dreams, happiness and love. Such penetrating insight into the hearts and minds of young people led to the absolute support that BTS has received from fans their age. The members again directly participated in the making of the songs, vowing to ensure that the songs reflect the reality of the music fans of their own generation."

Children are raised as studying machines without a chance to think about the future. A world where classmates are not friends but competitors trying to trample each other. BTS sings about the wounds and anguish that such hopeless life has left on today’s teens. ."

This is the product of the firm conviction and passion of BTS that hip hop musicians must make their voices heard through their albums. Each member flexed their musical prowess by taking part in creating the lyrics and music for every song on the album. BTS has repeatedly said that “hip hop is genuine music for telling one’s own story,” and indeed the members rap about their own experiences and emotions. There is no discontinuity between the emotions and lyrics of BTS. The album is a satisfaction in both quality and quantity."
